Experiments in writing a DSL in Python for interactive text based menu systems

Some things I'm contemplating:

- Create a request type object that has access to the menu system and the session storage. Simplifies the current `ms, session = yield` stuff a little bit.

- Data store needs to be more pluggable, it can currently be changed but it is ugly.
